### ADME
<b>A</b>bsorption, <b>D</b>istribution, <b>M</b>etabolism, <b>E</b>xcretion. Describes the disposition of a pharmaceutical compound within an organism.

### Binding Mode
The orientation of the ligand relative to the receptor as well as the conformation of the ligand and receptor when bound to each other.

### Cheminformatics
Refers to use of physical chemistry theory with computer and information science techniques.

### CNS
<b>C</b>entral <b>N</b>ervous <b>S</b>ystem

### DI
<b>D</b>ata <b>I</b>ntegration

### Dose-Response
The dose–response relationship, or exposure–response relationship, describes the magnitude of the response of an organism, as a function of exposure to a stimulus or stressor after a certain exposure time.

### Enumerate

### FEP+
<b>F</b>ree <b>E</b>nergy <b>P</b>erturbation calculations, high-performance free energy calculations. Given the binding affinity of compound X, FEP predicts the binding energy of similar ligands.

### HAC
<b>H</b>eavy <b>A</b>tom <b>C</b>ount

### HTS
<b>H</b>igh <b>T</b>hroughput <b>S</b>creening. HTS is a high-tech way to hasten the drug discovery process, allowing quick and efficient screening of large compound libraries at a rate of a few thousand compounds per day or per week.

### Lipinski
Lipinski’s rule of 5 – is a rule of thumb to evaluate druglikeness or determine if a chemical compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity has chemical properties and physical properties that would make it a likely orally active drug in humans.
Lipinski's rule states that, in general, an orally active drug has no more than one violation of the following criteria:
No more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (the total number of nitrogen–hydrogen and oxygen–hydrogen bonds)
No more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (all nitrogen or oxygen atoms)
A molecular mass less than 500 daltons
An octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) that does not exceed 5
Note that all numbers are multiples of five, which is the origin of the rule's name. As with many other rules of thumb, such as Baldwin's rules for ring closure, there are many exceptions.

### Pose
Candidate binding mode

### QSAR / QSPR
<b>Q</b>uantitative <b>S</b>tructure-<b>A</b>ctivity <b>R</b>elationship (Or <b>Q</b>uantitative <b>S</b>tructure-<b>P</b>roperty <b>R</b>elationship) is a computational modeling method for revealing relationships between structural properties of chemical compounds and biological activities

### RDKit
Open-source cheminformatics software

### RNN
<b>R</b>eturning <b>N</b>eurological <b>N</b>etwork

### SAR
<b>S</b>tructure-<b>A</b>ctivity <b>R</b>elationship

### SMILE
<b>S</b>implified <b>M</b>olecular-<b>I</b>nput <b>L</b>ine-<b>E</b>ntry <b>S</b>ystem is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species. Example: CC(=O)NCCC1=CNc2c1cc(OC)cc2 is melatonin.

### TTP
<b>T</b>arget <b>P</b>roduct <b>P</b>rofile is a key document which provides information to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the drug development process.

### Watermap
A new paradigm for ligand optimization.

### Whitepaper
An informational document usually issued by a company or not-for-profit organization to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service that it offers or plans to offer.

# Tech Lingo

### Feature freeze
Developer term. Not adding any more features, typically before a release

### SAML
Security Assertion Markup Language. User only need to sign in one time to access multiple service providers. This allows for a faster authentication process and less expectation for the user to remember multiple login credentials for every application.
How SAML authentication works.

### Staging Server
A staging server is a type of server that is used to test a software, website or service in a production-similar environment before being set live. It is part of a staging environment or staging site, where it serves as a temporary hosting and testing server for any new software or websites.
